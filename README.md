## Overview
### Requirements
- [x] Allow user to perform the math functions listed below on calculator once user inputs two numbers and selects an operator. The calculator should not evaluate more than a single pair of numbers at a time. 
      o	Add
      o	Subtract
      o	Multiply
      o	Divide
      o	Exponent
      o	Root
      o	Factorial

- [x]	Allow user to clear calculator memory.
- [x] Round answers so answer does not overflow the screen. 
- [x] Display error messages when user tries to divide by 0 or find a factorial of a floating-point number. 
- [x] Allow user to only add ‘.’ one time per number.

## Next Steps
- [x] Add a functional delete button, so the user can undo if they click the wrong numbers. 
- [x] Add key board support.
- [x] Refractor css using a mobile-first styling approach to allow for more responsiveness.
